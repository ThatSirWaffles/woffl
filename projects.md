A bespoke multipurpose Discord bot developed for [Skyrden](https://discord.gg/skyrden), created circa 2021, rewritten 3 times to the state it is in now. Since I left, the bot has been handed off to another maintainer, and the linked repo is an archive of the final state I left it in.

[•] Full ticket system with ticket claiming, snippets, bans and transcripts|
[•] Roblox-Discord user linking system|
[•] Cross platform points system, earned on Roblox, displayed on Discord|
[•] Basic community activity features|

[•] Hooks with another piece of Skyrden's infrastructure, the [Staff Hub](https://staff.skyrden.com)|
[•] API to control most features of the bot externally, notably from the Staff Hub|
