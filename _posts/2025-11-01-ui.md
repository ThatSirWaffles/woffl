title: Introduction to Roblox UI
---

I often see people taking the wrong approach to UI on Roblox, resulting in cluttered, unmaintainable and unresponsive interfaces. This article should give you a better understanding of the best practices to follow when working with UI, starting from the very basics.

If you’re already advanced, I recommend that you still read from the beginning, to make sure that you get the core notions right.

## Core concepts

### Udim

Roblox UI is sized and positioned using `Udim`. This data type is formatted as follows:

```
(scale, offset)
```

You’ll also commonly find `Udim2`, which is just a table of 2 Udims, where each Udim usually represents the X and Y axis respectively. It is formatted as such:

```
{(scale, offset), (scale, offset)}
 |----- X -----|  |----- Y -----|
```

| [•] | `scale` | Decimal number from 0-1 representing the proportion of the screen |
| | | <i>**Ex:** `0` is nothing, `0.5` is half of the screen, `1` is the entire screen</i> |
| [•] | `offset` | Number (positive and negative whole numbers) of pixels |

This might not make sense to you immediately, so here are some examples:

<div class="screen">
    <div class="bar" style="height: 2rem; width: 100%"></div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center">Size: <code>{(1, 0), (0, 50)}</code></p>
- The horizontal part is `(1, 0)` since the object occupies the entire horizontal space
- The vertical part is `(0, 50)` since it occupies only 50 pixels in height

<div class="screen">
    <div class="bar" style="height: 100%; width: 100%"></div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center">Size: <code>{(1, 0), (1, 0)}</code></p>
- The horizontal part is `(1, 0)` since the object occupies the entire horizontal space
- The vertical part is also `(1, 0)` since the object occupies the entire vertical space

<div class="screen">
    <div class="bar" style="height: 100%; width: 50%"></div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center">Size: <code>{(0.5, 0), (1, 0)}</code></p>
- The horizontal part is `(0.5, 0)` since the object occupies half (0.5) of the horizontal space
- The vertical part is  `(1, 0)` since the object occupies the entire vertical space

### Anchor Point

For now, we've been modifying the size of the frame, but Udim2 also applies to the position of the frame.

In all the following examples, suppose our frame is of size `{(0, 100), (0, 100)}`, so 100 by 100 pixels:

<div class="screen">
    <div class="bar" style="height: 4rem; width: 4rem; left: 50%; top: 50%; position: absolute; ">
        <div class="anchor" style="top: 100%"></div>
    </div>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center">Position: <code>{(0.5, 0), (0.5, 0)}</code></p>
- The horizontal part is `(0.5, 0)` since the object occupies half (0.5) of the horizontal space
- The vertical part is  `(1, 0)` since the object occupies the entire vertical space

### Combining Units

Let's try to apply what we know, by making a 500x500 frame in the centre of the screen. Making the frame 500 by 500 pixels just means setting the size to:

```
{(0, 500), (0, 500)}
```

<div class="screen">
    <div class="bar" style="height: 10rem; width: 10rem"></div>
</div>

But that's not centred. Remember that position uses the same logic as size. What does the center of the screen correspond to technically? It's the position at half of its height, and half of its width. And in Udim2, that corresponds to:

```
{(0.5, 0), (0.5, 0)}
```

<div class="screen">
    <div class="bar" style="top: 50%; left: 50%; height: 10rem; width: 10rem"></div>
</div>
