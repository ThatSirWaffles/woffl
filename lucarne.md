## Purchase a license
Lucarne licenses are meant to be very generous and accessible. Purchase it once, and use it anywhere, with absolutely no restrictions. Activating Lucarne only legitimises your game, and gives you access to certain cosmetic changes, all while supporting Lucarne's development. If funding drops too low, Lucarne cannot keep receiving regular updates.
